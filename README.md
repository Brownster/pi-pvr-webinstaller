## Installation

### Option 1: Command Line Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brownster/PI-PVR-0.1.git
cd PI-PVR-0.1
chmod +x pi-pvr.sh
./pi-pvr.sh
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to configure the environment, VPN, and file sharing.

### Option 2: Web-Based Installation (Recommended)

For a more user-friendly installation experience with a web interface:

```bash
chmod +x web-install.sh
./web-install.sh
```

This will start a web-based installer accessible at `http://<your-pi-ip>:8080` where you can:
- Configure all settings through an intuitive interface
- Monitor installation progress in real-time
- Easily reconfigure components after installation
- Access a dashboard for managing your media server

Alternatively, you can run:

```bash
chmod +x pi-pvr.sh
./pi-pvr.sh --web-installer
```

## Usage

### Modular Service Selection

Create a custom stack with exactly the services you need:

```bash
# Example: Full Arr suite with Jellyfin and Transmission
./scripts/generate-compose.sh --arr-apps --media-server jellyfin --torrent-client transmission

# Example: Complete media center with all components
./scripts/generate-compose.sh --all
```

### Service Management

Access your services via the web interface or directly from your browser:

| Service | Default URL | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Dashboard | http://\<IP\>:80 | Heimdall application dashboard |
| Prowlarr | http://\<IP\>:9696 | Indexer management |
| Sonarr | http://\<IP\>:8989 | TV show management |
| Radarr | http://\<IP\>:7878 | Movie management |
