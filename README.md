## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4/5 or any Linux-based system (4GB+ RAM recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose (handled by the installer)
- External storage for media files
- Internet connection
- VPN subscription for providers like PIA, NordVPN, etc. (optional but recommended)
- Tailscale account for secure remote access (optional)

## Installation

### Option 1: Command Line Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brownster/PI-PVR-0.1.git
cd PI-PVR-0.1
chmod +x pi-pvr.sh
./pi-pvr.sh
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to configure the environment, VPN, and file sharing.

### Option 2: Web-Based Installation (Recommended)

For a more user-friendly installation experience with a modern web interface:

```bash
chmod +x pi-pvr.sh
./pi-pvr.sh --web-ui
```

This will start a web-based installer accessible at `http://<your-pi-ip>:8080` where you can:
- Configure all settings through an intuitive, mobile-friendly interface
- Monitor installation progress in real-time with detailed status updates
- Easily manage your media services after installation with a comprehensive dashboard
- Monitor system resource usage with real-time graphs and statistics
- Configure storage, network, and service settings through a user-friendly interface
- View system and container logs with filtering and search capabilities
- Receive real-time notifications for important events and status changes
- Update Docker images and containers with a single click
- Restart, stop, or start services individually or in batch operations
- Access detailed documentation and help directly from the interface

### Option 3: Remote Installation

To install from your laptop directly to a remote Raspberry Pi or server:

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

Then select `Remote installation` from the menu. You'll be prompted to enter:
- Remote username (e.g., `pi`)
- Remote hostname or IP (e.g., `raspberrypi.local` or `192.168.1.100`)
- SSH port (default: 22)
- Installation directory (default: `/home/pi/pi-pvr`)
- Installation mode (`web` or `cli`)

## Usage

### Modular Service Selection

Create a custom stack with exactly the services you need:

```bash
# Example: Full Arr suite with Jellyfin and Transmission
./scripts/generate-compose.sh --arr-apps --media-server jellyfin --torrent-client transmission

# Example: Complete media center with all components
./scripts/generate-compose.sh --all
```

### Service Management

Access your services via the web interface or directly from your browser:

| Service | Default URL | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Dashboard | http://\<IP\>:80 | Heimdall application dashboard |
| Prowlarr | http://\<IP\>:9696 | Indexer management |
| Sonarr | http://\<IP\>:8989 | TV show management |
| Radarr | http://\<IP\>:7878 | Movie management |
| Lidarr | http://\<IP\>:8686 | Music management |
| Readarr | http://\<IP\>:8787 | Book management |
| Bazarr | http://\<IP\>:6767 | Subtitle management |
| Transmission | http://\<IP\>:9091 | Torrent client |
| NZBGet | http://\<IP\>:6789 | Usenet client |
| Jellyfin | http://\<IP\>:8096 | Open source media server |
| Get iPlayer | http://\<IP\>:1935 | BBC iPlayer downloader |

### Remote Access

Access your media server from anywhere using Tailscale:
- Replace `<IP>` with your Tailscale IP in service URLs
- Enjoy secure, encrypted connections without port forwarding

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Docker Compose

Modify the environment variables in the `.env` file to customize your setup:

```bash
cp ./docker-compose/.env.example ./.env
nano ./.env
```

### Hardware Acceleration

The installer automatically detects your hardware and configures the appropriate transcoding method:

- **Raspberry Pi**: Uses V4L2 hardware acceleration (VideoCore)
- **Intel/AMD**: Uses VAAPI hardware acceleration
- **NVIDIA**: Uses NVDEC hardware acceleration
- **Other Systems**: Falls back to software transcoding

After installation, hardware acceleration should be ready to use. You only need to:
1. Enable hardware acceleration in your media server settings
2. Choose the correct acceleration method (detected automatically)

## Testing

This project includes unit tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the codebase. The tests cover the following areas:

- **Python API Tests**: Located in the `scripts/test_api.py` file. These tests use the `pytest` framework to verify the functionality of the API endpoints defined in `scripts/api.py`. They cover aspects such as loading and saving configuration, managing services, and retrieving system information. To run these tests, use the command `pytest`.
- **JavaScript Web UI Tests**: Located in the `web-ui/test.js` file. These tests use the `Jest` framework to verify the functionality of the web UI components. They cover aspects such as making API requests and rendering UI elements. To run these tests, use the command `npm test`.
