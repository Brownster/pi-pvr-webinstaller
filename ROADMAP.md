# PI-PVR Ultimate Media Stack Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned enhancements to transform PI-PVR into the ultimate media stack installer for Raspberry Pi.

## A. Core Installer and Architecture Refinements

### 1. Modular Docker-Compose Architecture
- Create a base `docker-compose.base.yml` with core network and shared services
- Develop individual compose files for each service category:
  - `docker-compose.arr.yml` - Core Arr applications
  - `docker-compose.download.yml` - Download clients
  - `docker-compose.media.yml` - Media servers
  - `docker-compose.utilities.yml` - Supporting services
- Implement dynamic compose file merging based on user selections

### 2. Enhanced Parameterization
- Move all user-specific configuration to .env file
- Implement robust validation for all user-provided variables
- Create default profiles for different Raspberry Pi models and storage configurations
- Add backup/restore functionality for configuration

### 3. Improved Installation Process
- Add pre-installation system compatibility check
- Implement installation phases with proper error handling and rollback capabilities
- Create detailed logs and diagnostics features
- Add post-installation verification and testing

## B. Web-Based Front-End Enhancements

### 1. Modern Web UI
- Implement a React-based single-page application (SPA) frontend
- Create responsive design that works on mobile devices
- Add dark/light mode themes
- Develop intuitive configuration wizards with visual cues

### 2. Dashboard Features
- Real-time monitoring of service health
- Resource usage statistics (CPU, RAM, disk)
- Quick access to all installed services
- Simplified service management (start/stop/restart)
- One-click updates for services

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Add multi-language support
- Implement step-by-step guided setup with tooltips and explanations
- Create visual disk space and port allocation tools
- Add a comprehensive "Getting Started" guide for beginners
